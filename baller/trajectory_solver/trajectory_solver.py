    Solve for the trajectory of a projectile launched from position (x, y, z) with given pitch and yaw angles.
    Return the coordinates of the projectile when it passes the target_plane.

    Parameters:
    - x (float):            The x-coordinate of the launch position given in world coordinates (measured in meters)
    - y (float):            The y-coordinate of the launch position given in world coordinates (measured in meters)
    - z (float):            The z-coordinate of the launch position given in world coordinates (measured in meters)
    - pitch (float):        The pitch of the launch (up-down) (measured in radians)
    - yaw: (float):         The yaw of the launch (left-right) (measured in radians)
    - target_plane (float): The target is assumed to be located at x=target_plane

    Returns:
    - xp (float):           The x-coordinate of the projectile in the target plane (always equal to target_plane)
    - yp (float):           The y-coordinate of the projectile in the target plane
